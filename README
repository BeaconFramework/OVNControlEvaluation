Scripts to evaluate the scalability of OVN control plane using ovs-sim
utility.

* To set up number of hosts, ports, overlapping percentage and cores
assignments, update the vars at the top of perf/perf.rc file.
* To preview the randomly generated networks-to-hosts mappings run sudo
utilities/ovs-sim perf/dry.sh while being inside ovs directory.
* To run the actual measurements, run sudo utilities/ovs-sim perf/test.sh
instead.
* To reset the networks-to-hosts mapping remove rand* files from perf/tmp.
* Use -i flag of ovs-sim to stop the simulator before clean-up, so you can
inspect and further tweak or test the created environment.
* Running the tests results in a few perf/perf.data.* files which can be
inspected offline using perf report -i <filename> to see which functions
 of which executables took most of the cycles.
